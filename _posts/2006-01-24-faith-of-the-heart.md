## Faith of The Heart

### written by Diane Warren and sung by Russell Watson

It's been a long road   
Getting from there to here   
It's been a long time   
But my time is finally near   
And I will see my dream come alive at last,   
I will touch the sky   
And they're not gonna hold me down no more   
No, they're not gonna<!--more--> change my mind   
Cause I got faith of the heart   
I'm going where my heart will take me   
I got faith to believe   
I can do anything   
I got strength of the soul   
And no one's gonna bend or break me   
I can reach any star   
I got faith   
Faith of the heart...
