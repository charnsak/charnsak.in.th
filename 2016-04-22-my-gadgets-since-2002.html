<p>
	I would consider myself as a step from &quot;Geek&quot;<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6;">. I love using Gadgets.&nbsp;My first post-pc era device was&nbsp;CASIO Casiopeia E200 Pocket PC. It was so excited to have computing power on your hand. Next I use Pocket PC from HP IPAQ 1930. It is my favorite handheld device for all time. I like the design/weight material and everything. I spend a lot of time playing with it. It have no bluetooth/cellular.</span></p>

	By using those two Pocket PC model. It opened a new world for me as a <strong><em>Columnist</em></strong>. I first wrote a column in <strong>Pocket PC Magz</strong> since <strong>2003</strong>&nbsp;(I was a third year student) until the magazine was closed in <strong>2006</strong>. I missed only one or two publication during that time. (My screen name is otorabi). I begin to write the article on PC World Magazine since <strong>2005</strong> to <strong>2012</strong>. Yes... The Magazine have closed itself.</p>
