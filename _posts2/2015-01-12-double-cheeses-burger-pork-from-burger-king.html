<p>Sometime I feel bored of normal food that I have everyday.<br />
Mostly, I have a normal good that can be found everywhere. however, I would like to have a burger.</p>
<p>I went to McDonald drive through and bought a double cheese burger. There are no pickle or any vegetable inside. </p>
<p>I have a chance to go don mueng airport. I bought an overpriced double cheese burger from burger king.</p>
<p>The price of this burger is 295 oop.</p>
<p>the taste was not so good. However, I feel satisfied after finished this one.</p>
<p>I would eat burger king about 1-2 times a year.  </p>
