<p><font size="+2">Hugh Grant - Way Back Into Love lyrics</font></p>
<p>I've been living with a shadow overhead <br />I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed <br />I've been lonely for so long <br />Trapped in the past <br />I just can't seem to move on </p>
<p>I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away <br />Just in case I ever need them again someday <br />I've<!--more--> been setting aside time <br />To clear a little space in the corners of my mind </p>
<p>All I want to do is find a way back into love <br />I can't make it through without a way back into love<br />Oh oh oh </p>
<p>I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine <br />I've been searching but i just don't see the signs <br />I know that it's out there <br />There's got to be something for my soul somewhere </p>
<p>I've been looking for someone to shed some light <br />Not somebody just to get me through the night <br />I could use some direction <br />And I'm open to your suggestions </p>
<p>All I want to do is find a way back into love <br />I can't make it through without a way back into love <br />And if I open my heart again <br />I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end </p>
<p>Oh oh oh</p>
<p>There are moments when I don't know if it's real <br />Or if anybody feels the way I feel <br />I need inspiration <br />Not just another negotiation </p>
<p>All I want to do is find a way back into love <br />I can't make it through without a way back into love <br />And if I open my heart to you <br />I'm hoping you'll show me what to do <br />And if you help me to start again <br />You know that I'll be there for you in the end</p>
<p>Oh oh oh</p>
