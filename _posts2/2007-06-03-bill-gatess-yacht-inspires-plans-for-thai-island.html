<p>Oh, to be Bill Gates’s yacht. The waters you’d sail. The navigational software that would chart your course. The luxury tourism developments you’d inspire. Developer Gulu Lalvani says a conversation he had with Gates in Phuket, Thailand earlier this year has inspired him to build a small island just<!--more--> off the Thailand coast in Phang Nga Bay. As Lalvani recalled, Gates told him: “If I could bring my yacht, I would come here every year.” The trouble is, Gates’s 54-meter yacht (a little larger than the pleasure craft pictured here) is too big for Phuket’s marina, which holds yachts up to 40 meters long. <br />Lalvani’s island would not only have berths accommodating much bigger boats, but it would include a five-star hotel and luxury condos.<br />He described it as “a mini-Palm Island, like in Dubai.”<br />But don’t try to reserve a berth just yet.<br />Reports the <a title="International Herald Tribune" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/23/properties/reyacht.php">International Herald Tribune</a>: “The project is still more of a concept than a reality, with Lalvani expecting to spend the next three years planning before the start of construction.”<br />Lalvani <a title="told Reuters" href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=59d9ef34-5d5e-48db-b8b5-1fa62eff8aaa&amp;k=71551">told Reuters</a> he was bullish on post-tsunami tourism.<br />“First quarter arrivals and hotel occupancy were at an all time record,” he said. “2005 was a disaster but now every hotelier is over the moon. The tsunami’s a thing of the past, everyone’s forgotten about it.”<br />Well, <a title="not everyone everywhere" href="http://newstodaynet.com/09may/rf9.htm">not everyone everywhere</a>.<br />Photo of Phuket waters by <a title="yeowatzup" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yeowatzup/173832203/">yeowatzup</a> via Flickr, (<a title="Creative Commons" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en_US">Creative Commons</a>).</p>
